global protocol Streaming (role Y, role U) {
  rec X {
    choice at U {
      DATA from Y to U;
      MORE from U to Y; (*) this message makes it a bit unpleasant as a streamming protocol
      continue X;
    } or {
      DONE from U to Y;
    }
  }
}

(* Note:

While the message MORE makes the whole point of avoiding the
synchronisation moot, it is needed to avoid Y from saturating U. This
restriction may be lifted later, but it is needed. However, unline
non-mixed state MPST in this case Y can start streaming immediately
after the sesion starts.
